The Obvious Contributors License Agreement
==========================================

Version 1.0
-----------

### Preface

The Agreement is an agreement between You, the Users, the
Contributors, and The Obvious Corporation. The intent of The Agreement
is to clarify what it means for You to become one of The Contributors.

The Agreement is meant to protect You, the Users, the Contributors,
and The Obvious Corporation from the malicious misdeeds of others.
The Agreement is *not* intended to restrict how You use Your own
Contributions.

The Agreement is written in plain English and as such is meant to be
reasonably understood by You and all those affected by it. The terms
defined below and used throughout this document are capitalized in
order to reduce ambiguity, but they should generally be understood to
have their usual colloquial meanings.


### Definitions

1. "The Agreement" &mdash; This document.

2. "You" / "Your" &mdash; The person signing The Agreement.

3. "The Obvious Corporation" &mdash; The company which manages the projects
   in question. The company's website is at <http://obvious.com/>.

4. "Project" / "Projects" &mdash; Open source projects being managed by The
   Obvious Corporation. The Projects may all be found at
   <https://github.com/Obvious> with an overview at
   <https://github.com/Obvious/open-source>.

5. "Contribution" / "Contributions" &mdash; Code, content, and ideas
   that are meant to be integrated into Projects. Issues (bug report)
   and pull requests (suggestions to integrate content) filed on a
   Project are implicitly Contributions, unless they clearly state
   up-front, "This is not a contribution." Contributions may take
   other forms as well, including (but not limited to) email or other
   more general communication intended to be received by one or more
   Contributors.

6. "Contributor" / "Contributors" &mdash; Those people and
   corporations that provide Contributions.

7. "License" / "Licenses" &mdash; The terms under which Projects are
   licensed. Each Project may have a different License. In any case,
   the License for a given Project is clearly identified in the
   documentation for that Project.

8. "User" / "Users" &mdash; Those people, projects, and companies which
   make use of the Projects. Making use of a Project includes (but is
   not limited to) compiling and/or running its content, taking some
   action which causes its content to be used, copying its content,
   distributing its content, modifying its content, and even taking
   its content and/or ideas for a less direct purpose.


### Agreement Per Se

When You provide a Contribution to a Project:

* You assert that the Contribution was authored by You.

* You agree to license that Contribution under the terms of the
  License of that Project. More specifically, You grant an irrevocable
  license for Your Contribution to the Users, the Contributors, and
  The Obvious Corporation.

* You assert that You are free and able to license Your Contribution
  under the License of that Project.

* If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create
  which may include Your Contribution, then You assert that Your
  employer has granted You explicit permission to the Contribution
  on behalf of Your employer.

Furthermore:

* You assert that You are free and able to agree to The Agreement.

* If You become aware of a problem with any of Your Contributions or
  with the fact that You have signed The Agreement, then You agree to
  inform The Obvious Corporation about the problem, without any undue
  delay.
