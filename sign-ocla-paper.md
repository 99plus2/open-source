Sign the OCLA: Dead Tree Edition
================================

Even though we at The Obvious Corporation would love to leave the
paper world behind, various jurisdictions require that we also accept
physically signed documents. If you wish to take advantage of this
when signing the OCLA, then all you need to do is mail us a document
with the following content:

```
[date]

I hereby agree to the terms of the Obvious Contributors License
Agreement, version 1.0, with MD5 checksum
fbe613f727e76c93e4a5967536c87fbe.

I furthermore declare that I am free and able to make this agreement
and sign this declaration.

Signed,

[your name]
https://github.com/[your github userid]
[your email address]
[your address]
[your phone number]
```

Replace the bracketed text as follows:

* `[date]` with today's date, in the unambiguous numeric form `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `[your name]` with your name.
* `[your github userid]` with your GitHub userid.
* `[your email address]` with an email address at which you can be
  contacted.
* `[your address]` with a physical mailing address at which you can be
  contacted.
* `[your phone number]` with a phone number at which you can be contacted.

Send the letter to:

    The Obvious Corporation
    Attention: Open Sourceror
