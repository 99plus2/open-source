Sign the OCLA
=============

This page is the step-by-step guide to signing the Obvious
Contributors License Agreement. It's easy and pretty painless!

1. First and foremost, read [the current version of the
   OCLA](./ocla-1.0.md). It is written to be as close to plain
   English as possible.

2. Make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't already
   have one.

3. File a pull request on this project (the Obvious Open Source
   Umbrella Project), as outlined below.

4. Wait for an Obvious team member to merge your pull request.

5. Contribute!

Filing the Pull Request
-----------------------

If you don't yet know how to file a pull request, read [GitHub's
document about it](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Make your pull request be the addition of a single file to the
[contributors](contributors) directory of this project. Name the file
with the same name as your GitHub userid, with `.md` appended to the
end. For example, for the user `danfuzz`, the full path to the file
would be `contributors/danfuzz.md`.

Put the following in the file:

```
[date]

I hereby declare that I agree to the terms of the Obvious Contributors
License Agreement, version 1.0, with MD5 checksum
0ab157203a2d3b068671f2280ff0517e.

I furthermore declare that I am free and able to make this agreement
and sign this declaration.

Signed,

[your name]
https://github.com/[your github userid]
```

Replace the bracketed text as follows:

* `[date]` with today's date, in the unambiguous numeric form `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `[your name]` with your name.
* `[your github userid]` with your GitHub userid.

That's it!
